# PingPong_Game_Embedded_System
This project is about a Ping Pong game with a Distributed Embedded Control System. It was proposed in TTK4155 - Embedded and Industrial Computer Systems course of the Department of Engineering Cybernetics at Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and it will be implemented by me and two other exchange students.
The main challenge will be to assemble the hardware components and develop software for the microcontrollers, making a fully functional embedded computer system that will enable you to play a refreshing game of ping pong.
